# MLFluvUnet: a Fluvial U-Net Segmentation Model

MLFluvUnet is a U-Net based model for multi-class segmentation of remote sensing images. It is built on top of PyTorch and designed specifically for fluvial environments.

## Directory Structure

The main scripts are located in the `MODEL_LAYER` directory:

- `dataset.py`: Defines the `MLFluvDataset()` class, a PyTorch dataset class that ingests data created by the scripts in the `DATA_LAYER` folder.

- `model.py`: Defines the `SMPUnet()` class, which wraps a basic U-Net model from the  [Segmentation Models.Pytorch](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch) package. It includes additional functionalities such as masking data, freezing/defreezing encoders, and loading pre-trained models with a modified number of classes.

- `weight_calculator.py`: This script is designed to calculate class weights that can be incorporated into loss functions. Given the significant class imbalance in the dataset, this script offers a mechanism to compute a weighting schedule from a set of provided options (inverse_log, inverse_log_percent, inverse_count, inverse_sqrt). This computed schedule can be applied to the loss function during the model training process. This approach aids in mitigating the effects of class imbalance and enhances the modelâ€™s performance on minority classes.

- `interface.py`: Defines the `MLFluvUnetInterface()` class, which includes functions for training on one epoch, validating the model, and training on many epochs in a loop.

- `train.py`: Used for training an initial U-Net model from a general land use and land cover (LULC) map. In this study, we choose ESRI land cover map. 

- `inference.py`: Used for making predictions with a model that is trained by `train.py`.

- `fine_tune.py`: Used for incremental learning on the initial U-Net model. The trained model will be loaded and modified for incremental classes (e.g., the fluvial sediment class) in the new dataset.

- `config.json`: This is a configuration file that contains a dictionary of parameters required for training, inference, and modifying training settings. Users can easily conduct experiments with different model settings by simply modifying this file. The settings include, but are not limited to, tweaking hyperparameters, changing the training data directory, and modifying logging directories. This approach provides a flexible and user-friendly way to manage and customize the model training and inference process.

## Getting Started

To train the initial U-Net model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

To make predictions with the trained model, run:
```bash
python inference.py
```

To perform incremental learning on the initial U-Net model, run:
```bash
python fine_tune.py
```
